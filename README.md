# NFTSentimentAnalysis
Apply natural language processing to understand the sentiment in the latest news articles featuring NFTs. Apply fundamental NLP techniques to better understand the other factors involved with the coin prices such as common words and phrases and organizations and entities mentioned in the articles

***The following approach was followed to generate sentiment analysis for an NFT collection and check its correlation to price action***
- Get twitter data for 1 week from Twitter using Tweepy API
- Sanitize the data to remove emojis, special characters, mentions, hyperlinks
- User Vader SentimentIntensityAnalyser to get the sentiment of tweets 
- Classify the sentiment as positive/non-positive based on compound score >0.1
- Use this classified data for training the RNN LSTM model to classify future tweets
- The model did not do well, probably becuase of the type of data (short tweets with spelling mistakes and repeat texts), so it was not used further for analysis
- The price for the collection for 1 week was then fetched from OpenSea using API provided by OpenSea
- The sentiment and proce for the 1 week period were then plotted to identify correlation between the two

***This project uses the library tweepy to get the data from twitter***
